## Problem

Given an array of positive integers  **arr[]**, return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return  **-1.** 

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

 **Examples:** 

```
Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.
```

```
Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.
```

                sl=l;
                l=arr[i];
            }
            else{
                if(arr[i]>sl&&arr[i]!=l){
                    sl=arr[i];
                }
            }
        }
        return sl;
    }
}
