## Problem

### Temperature-Based Weather Advice

Write a program that takes the temperature as input and prints a weather message. The program should use an  **if-else if**  structure to determine the appropriate message based on the given temperature.

 **Input:** 
A single integer representing the temperature.

 **Condition:** 

- If the temperature is above 30, print: "It's hot outside! Stay hydrated."
- If the temperature is between 10 and 30 (inclusive), print: "The weather is moderate. Enjoy your day!"
- If the temperature is below 10, print: "It's cold outside! Wear warm clothes."

```java
import java.util.Scanner; // Import Scanner class to take input from the user

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // Create a Scanner object for user input
        
        // Read user input and store it in the 'temperature' variable
        
        int n = scanner.nextInt();


        // Check if the temperature is above 30
        if(n>30){
            System.out.println("It's hot outside! Stay hydrated.");
        }else if(n>10 && n<=30){
            System.out.println("The weather is moderate. Enjoy your day!");
        }else {
            System.out.println("It's cold outside! Wear warm clothes.");
        }
        

        scanner.close(); // Close the Scanner object to free up resources
    }
}

```
