## Problem

### Gym Eligibility

This program takes a user's details and determines their eligibility for gym entry based on their  **age, membership status**, and whether they are  **accompanied by a member**. The program uses an  **if-else statement**  to check these conditions.

 **Input:** 

- age (an integer)
- hasMembershipCard (a boolean)
- isAccompaniedByMember (a boolean)
- isBanned (a boolean).

 **Condition:** 

- If the user is banned, print: "Not eligible for gym entry due to ban."
- If the user is 18 or older and has a membership card, print: "Eligible for gym entry with a membership card."
- If the user is 18 or older and is accompanied by a member, print: "Eligible for gym entry when accompanied by a member."
- If none of the conditions are met, print: "Not eligible for gym entry."

import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        int age = sc.nextInt(); // User's age
        boolean hasMembershipCard = sc.nextBoolean(); // Whether the user has a membership card
        boolean isAccompaniedByMember = sc.nextBoolean(); // Whether the user is accompanied by a member
        boolean isBanned = sc.nextBoolean(); // Whether the user has been banned previously

        // Check if the user has been banned
        if (isBanned) {
            System.out.println("Not eligible for gym entry due to ban.");
        } 
        // Check if the user is at least 18 years old and has a membership card
        else if (age >= 18 && hasMembershipCard) {
            System.out.println("Eligible for gym entry with a membership card.");
        } 
        // Check if the user is at least 18 years old and accompanied by a member
        else if (age >= 18 && isAccompaniedByMember) {
            System.out.println("Eligible for gym entry when accompanied by a member.");
        } 
        // If the user does not meet any eligibility criteria
        else {
            System.out.println("Not eligible for gym entry.");
