## Problem

### Fall Prevention

An array $A$ of length $N$ is called  *good*  if

$$ A_1 + A_2 + \ldots + A_i \ge 0 $$

for  *every*  $1 \le i \le N$.

You are given an array $A$. You may delete at most one element from the array, without changing the order of the remaining elements.
Is it possible to do this such that the resulting array is  *good* ?

### Input Format
- The first line of input will contain a single integer $T$, denoting the number of test cases.
- Each test case consists of two lines of input. The first line of each test case contains a single integer $N$ — the length of the array. The second line contains $N$ space-separated integers $A_1, \ldots, A_N$.
### Output Format

For each test case, output on a new line the answer: `Yes` if it's possible to obtain a good array after deleting at most one element, and `No` otherwise.

### Constraints
- $1 \leq T \leq 10^5$
- $2 \leq N \leq 2\cdot 10^5$
- $-10^4 \le A_i \le 10^4$
- The sum of $N$ over all test cases won't exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4
4
1 0 2 -1
3
1 -2 -2
5
2 -1 -2 1 0
4
0 -1 -1 3

```

```
YES
NO
YES
NO

```

### Explanation:

 **Test case $1$:**  We have $A = [1, 0, 2, -1]$. The array is already  *good*  without deleting any elements, because the corresponding sums are:

- $1$
- $1+0=1$
- $1+0+2=3$
- $1+0+2+(-1) = 2$

which are all $\ge 0$.

 **Test case $2$:**  We have $A = [1, -2, -2]$.

- If we delete the $1$, the array starts with $-2$ and hence is not good.
- If we delete one of the $-2$'s, the array becomes $[1, -2]$ and $1+(-2) = -1 \lt 0$, so this isn't good either.

Thus, it's impossible to make the array  *good*  after a single deletion.

 **Test case $3$:**  We can delete $A_2 = -1$ to obtain the array $[2, -2, 1, 0]$, which can be verified to be  *good*.

```cpp
tjgtvnr = int(input())
 
for _ in range(tjgtvnr):
    njvnrkcnr = int(input())
    aefnncdcre = list(map(int, input().split()))
    
    prefix = 0
    min_element = 0
    delete = False
    poecn = True
    
    for x in aefnncdcre:
        prefix += x
        min_element = min(min_element, x)
        
        if prefix < 0:
            if delete:
                possible = False
                break
            
            
            prefix -= min_element
            delete = True
            
            if prefix < 0:
                possible = False
                break
    print("YES" if possible else "NO")
```
