 **Input:**  Take input for n from the user.

 **Steps to complete:** 

- Use a while loop to run from i = 1 to i <= n.
- Inside the loop, check if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 using %. If true, print the number. If false, then dont output anything
- Increment i in each iteration.

        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int i = 1;
        
        while (i <= n) {
            // Check if i is divisible by both 3 and 5
            if (i % 3 == 0 && i % 5 == 0) {
                System.out.println(i);
            }
            i++;
        }
