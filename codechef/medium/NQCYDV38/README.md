## Problem

### Incorrect Index

Strings in Java have zero-based indexing.
This means that the first index is 0.
It is easy to forget that and use one-based indexing instead.
This incorrect indexing leads to another logical error.

 **Program to print the last character of the string** 

```
Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
String s = scanner.nextLine();    // input string
int n = s.length();               // find length of string
        
System.out.println(s.charAt(n - 1));   // Correct way to access the n-th character
System.out.println(s.charAt(n));       // incorrect way

```

### Task
- Given a program to print 1st, 4th and 6th character of a string
- Find out the logical error and solve it
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
