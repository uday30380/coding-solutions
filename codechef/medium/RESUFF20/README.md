## Problem

### Assign Grades Based on Marks

Write a Program to Calculate the Grade Based on Marks This program prompts the user to enter their  **marks**  and uses a  **ternary operator**  to assign the corresponding grade based on the input. The grade will be one of  **"A+", "A", "B", "C", or "Fail"**, depending on the mark range.

 **Input:** 
A single integer representing the marks obtained by the student.

 **Condition:** 

- If the marks are 90 or above, assign grade "A+".
- If the marks are between 80 and 89, assign grade "A".
- If the marks are between 70 and 79, assign grade "B".
- If the marks are between 60 and 69, assign grade "C".
- If the marks are below 60, assign grade "Fail".

Run the program, enter different marks, and check the output for the corresponding grade!

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
85
```

```
The grade is: A

```

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
72
```

```
The grade is: B

```

```java
import java.util.Scanner; // Import Scanner class for taking input from the user

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); // Create a Scanner object for user input

        // Read the marks input from the user
        int marks = scanner.nextInt(); 

        // Use a ternary operator to calculate the grade based on marks
        // Check marks and assign grade as "A+", "A", "B", "C", or "Fail"
        String grade = (marks >= 90) ? "A+" : 
                       (marks >= 80) ? "A" : 
                       (marks >= 70) ? "B" : 
                       (marks >= 60) ? "C" : "Fail";

        // Output the calculated grade
        System.out.println("The grade is: " + grade);

        scanner.close(); // Close the Scanner object to free up resources
    }
}

```
