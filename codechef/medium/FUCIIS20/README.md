## Problem

### Sum of Even Numbers in a Series

Write a program that takes an integer input representing the upper limit (`n`) and calculates the sum of all even numbers from `1` to `n`. If a number is evenly divisible by `2`, it is considered even and added to the sum.

 **Input:** 
A single integer representing the upper limit of the series.

Run the code, enter different values, and check how the sum of even numbers changes!

### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
10
```

```
The sum of even numbers is: 30  
```

```java
import java.util.Scanner; // Import the Scanner class for user input

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a Scanner object for taking input
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in); 
        int n = scanner.nextInt(); 
        int sum = 0; // Initialize the variable to store the sum of even numbers

        // Loop from 1 to n
        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                sum+=i;
            }
        }

        // Print the final sum of all even numbers in the range
        System.out.println("The sum of even numbers is: " + sum);
    }
}

```
