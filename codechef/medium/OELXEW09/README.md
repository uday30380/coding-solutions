## Problem

### Tracking Monthly Expenses

In this exercise, we are working with a system to track monthly expenses. The goal is to initialize arrays for various expenses and print them to verify correct initialization and assignment.

```
expenses = 2000.50, 1500.75, 800.25, 1200.00, 500.00
newExpenses = 100.00, 150.00, 75.50

```

 **Expected Output:** 

```
Rent Expense: 2000.5
Grocery Expense: 1500.75
Internet Bill: 100.0
Gym Membership: 150.0

```

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Static Initialization: Expenses in specific categories
         // Rent, groceries, utilities, travel, others
          double[] expenses= {2000.5, 1500.75, 800.25, 1200.00, 500.00};

        System.out.println("Rent Expense: " + expenses[0]);
        System.out.println("Grocery Expense: " + expenses[1]);

        // Dynamic Initialization: Add expenses later
        double[] newExpenses = {100.00, 150.00, 75.50};

        System.out.println("Internet Bill: " + newExpenses[0]);
        System.out.println("Gym Membership: " + newExpenses[1]);
    }
}

```
