## Problem

### Movie Night Eligibility Checker

Write a program that checks if a package qualifies for same-day delivery based on two conditions: whether the destination is within the city `OR` the order was placed before `2` PM. The program should take user input for both factors and determine if the package meets the criteria.

 **Input:** 

- A boolean (true or false) indicating whether the destination is within the city.
- An integer representing the order time in 24-hour format.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
true  
15  

```

```
Package qualifies for same-day delivery.

```

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
false  
16  

```

```
Package does not qualify for same-day delivery.

```

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Taking user input for delivery conditions
        
        boolean correct = scanner.nextBoolean();
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        
        if(correct == true||n<=24)
        {
            System.out.println("Package qualifies for same-day delivery.");
        }else{
            System.out.println("Package does not qualify for same-day delivery.");
        }



        // Checking eligibility for same-day delivery
