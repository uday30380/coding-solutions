## Problem

### Chef and Groups

There are $N$ seats arranged in a row. Each seat is either empty or occupied.

You are given a binary string $S$ of length $N$. A character `0` represents an empty seat, while a character `1` represents an occupied seat.

People sitting in consecutive occupied seats belong to the  **same group**.

For example, in the string `011010`, the occupied seats form two groups: `11` and `1`.

Find the  **total number of groups**.

### Input Format
- The first line contains a single integer $N$ — the number of seats.
- The second line contains a binary string $S$ of length $N$.
### Output Format
- Print a single integer — the number of groups of occupied seats.
### Constraints
- $1 \le N \le 10^5$
- $S_i \in \{0,1\}$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
3
101
```

```
2
```

### Explanation:

The two occupied seats are separated by an empty seat, so they form two different groups.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
10
1001101011
```

```
4
```

### Explanation:

The string is `1001101011`.

The occupied seats form the groups `1`, `11`, `1`, and `11`.

Therefore, the total number of groups is  **4**.
