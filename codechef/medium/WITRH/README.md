## Problem

### Within Reach

A robot is standing at position $X$ on a  **one-dimensional line**, and its charging station is located at position $Y$ on the same line.

The robot can move  **either left or right**  and can travel at most $K$ units with its remaining battery.

Determine whether the robot can  **reach the charging station**.

### Input Format
- The first line contains three space-separated integers $X$, $Y$, and $K$.
### Output Format
- Print YES if the robot can reach the charging station.
- Otherwise, print NO.
### Constraints
- $0 \le X,Y \le 100$
- $0 \le K \le 100$
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
4 11 7
```

```
YES
```

### Explanation:

The charging station is $7$ units away from the robot.

Since the robot can travel at most $7$ units, it can reach the charging station.

### Sample 2:
Input
Output

```
12 3 5
```

```
NO
```

### Explanation:

The charging station is $9$ units away from the robot.

Since the robot can travel only $5$ units, it cannot reach the charging station.
