## Problem

### Searching for the Last Dot in a File Path

Complete the program by filling in the missing parts to find the last occurrence of a dot (`.`) in a file path using the `lastIndexOf()` method. This will help locate the file extension or other important information from the file path.

```
String filePath = "C:\\Users\\Documents\\myFile.java";

```

 **Expected Output:** 

```
The last dot is at index: 25

```

 **If you think the answer is 28, that’s incorrect, because as we studied in escape sequences, // is treated as a single character.**

```java
class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define a filePath string
        String filePath = "C:\\Users\\Documents\\myFile.java";

        // Find the last occurrence of the dot
        int lastIndexOfDot = filePath.lastIndexOf(".");

        // Print the result
        System.out.println("The last dot is at index: " + lastIndexOfDot);

    }
}

```
