## Problem

### Generating a Fibonacci Series Using While Loop

The  **Fibonacci series**  is a sequence of numbers where each term is the  **sum of the two preceding terms**, starting with `0` and `1`.
For example: `0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13,...`

Your task is to write a program to generate the Fibonacci series based on user input.

 **Input:** 
Take the input for n, which represents the total number of terms to print.

 **Steps to Complete:** 

- Ask the user to enter the number of terms (must be ≥ 2).
- Use a while loop to generate and print the next Fibonacci numbers by summing the last two terms.
- Continue the loop until the required number of terms is printed.
### Sample 1:
Input
Output

```
7
```

```
Fibonacci Series: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
```

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Take user input for the number of terms
        int terms = scanner.nextInt();

        int first = 0, second = 1; // First two Fibonacci numbers
        int count = 2; // Counter to track the number of terms generated

        // Print first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence
        System.out.print("Fibonacci Series: " + first + " " + second + " ");
        

        // Use while loop to generate the remaining Fibonacci numbers
        while(count<terms)
        {
            int sum=first+second;
            System.out.print(sum+" ");
            first=second;
            second=sum;
            count++;
        }







        scanner.close(); // Close the scanner
    }
}

```
