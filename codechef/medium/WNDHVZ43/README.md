## Problem

### Worked Example - Online Exam Eligibility

In this example, we demonstrate how to use an if-else statement with the logical && operator to check if a student is eligible to take an online exam. This method helps in understanding multiple conditions using and in Java.

 **When executed, the code will show:** 

```
You are eligible to take the exam.  
Eligibility check completed.  

```

```java
import java.util.*;

class Codechef {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Variables representing eligibility conditions
        boolean hasRegistered = true;
        int attendancePercentage = 80;
        int requiredAttendance = 75;

        // Check if student is registered and meets attendance requirement
        if (hasRegistered && (attendancePercentage >= requiredAttendance)) {
            System.out.println("You are eligible to take the exam.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("You are not eligible to take the exam.");
        }

        System.out.println("Eligibility check completed.");
    }
}

```
